/*Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight. It can be calculated by taking your 
weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a dart code that 
prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and display the BMI.
Note: 1 pound = .45359237 kg and 1 inch = 0.254 meters*/
